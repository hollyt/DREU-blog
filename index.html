            Justine Cassell (Ph.D., University of Chicago) has joined the <a href="www.hcii.cmu.edu">Human-Computer Interaction Institute</a> at Carnegie Mellon University as Director. Cassell comes to CMU from Northwestern, where she was the founding director of the <a href="http://tsb.northwestern.edu/">Technology and Social Behavior</a> joint PhD in Communication and Computer Science, and of the <a href="http://tsb.northwestern.edu/">Center for Technology and Social Behavior</a>. Before Northwestern, Cassell was a tenured faculty member at the <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/">MIT Media Lab</a>, where she headed the Gesture and Narrative Language research group. Cassell's research focuses on understanding natural forms of communication, and then creating technological tools for those forms of communication and linguistic expression to flourish in the digital world. In particular, she is credited with developing the Embodied Conversational Agent, a virtual human capable of interacting with humans using both language and nonverbal behavior. More recently Cassell has investigated the role that the ECA can play in children's lives, as a part of a Story Listening System, an interactive support for learning language and literacy skills.

          <h1 id="Project">About My Project</h1>
          <p class="text-justify">I'm working on the <a href="http://www.articulab.justinecassell.com/projects/rapport.html">Connection Machines Project</a>, which is typically refered to as the Rapport Project within the lab. Based on research that suggests rapport between two peers benefits learning in a peer tutoring situation, the Rapport Project aims to create a computational model of rapport management, and ultimately create a virtual agent that is about to create, maintain, and build rapport with a human user in real-time.</p>
          <p class ="text-justify">My task within the Rapport Project is to implement the Friendship Classifier, which is a module that will be used to build the virtual agent peer tutor. It is a binary module that decides whether or not the virtual agent and human peer are friends when given multimodal input such as the peer's smile, gaze, and speech. The system will be trained using data from the recorded peer tutoring sessions and will learn using a support vector machine. My ultimate goal is to create a module that will interact with other modules that execute Intention Understanding, Rapport Generation, Behavior Planning, etc. to create a virtual agent that can create, maintain, and break rapport with a user in order to facilitate a better learning environment.</p>
