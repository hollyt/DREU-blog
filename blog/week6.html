				<h1>Week 6 - 06.30.14 - 07.04.14</h1>

				<p>Wow, I can’t believe that I’m already halfway through my time at the ArticuLab! This week I ran multiple iterations of cross validation using a leave-one-dyad-out method so I can find the c-value that maximizes the accuracy of my svm.</p>

				<p>I ended up doing over 500 iterations of training and testing with values ranging from c = 0.03 to c = 100! This ended up taking quite a bit of time since higher c-values means longer runtimes for my classifier, and I could only get three different iterations running on my computer without crashing it.</p>

				<p>The highest average accuracy I achieved was 64%, so I’m looking into some methods for selecting the most important features from our data set. That should raise the accuracy results!</p>

				<p>This week I read a very informative and entertaining article - A Few Useful Things to Know About Machine Learning. It gives helpful hints about implementing algorithms, specifically classifiers, in Machine Learning. It’s written in a way that makes it very accessible and I think it’s a great article for Machine Learning beginners. I wish I had read it at the start of my project!</p>
