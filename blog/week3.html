				<h1>Week 3 - 06.09.14 - 06.13.14</h1>

				<p>This week I really started to work on building my classifier. It will be implemented in C++ and use the libsvm library for Support Vector Machine Implementation. </p>

				<p>I’m using data that was collected when the lab ran studies in which they recorded 16 dyads (8 friend dyads and 8 stranger dyads) working together to tutor each other in algebra. The data including low-level audio features, low-level visual features, and dyadic features* was extracted by a phD student in the lab and saved in the form of a Matlab vector. The libsvm library takes a very specifically formatted text file as input, so I needed to find a way to convert the Matlab data into the libsvm format:
				<BR><BR>
				[label][index1]:[value1][index2]:[value2] … </p>

				<p>It took quite a bit longer than I expected to get the data in the correct format since I’m dealing with a lot of data and I need to make sure that everything is formatted correctly and nothing gets mixed up in the conversion process.</p>

				<p>I ended up having to go through multiple steps to get the data in the correct format:
				<ol>
					<li>Use the Matlab function xlswrite() to convert the matrix into an xls file.</li>
					<li>Convert the xls file into a CSV file in Excel.</li>
					<li>Write a Python script that converts the CSV file into a text file, adds the correct index to each feature value, converts the text file to a train file, and adds the binary friend classification value to each data point.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>My reading list for this week focused on influential work in the field of Embodied Conversational Agents by Justine.</p>

				<hr>
				<p>* Dyadic features are multimodal patterns of interaction between two people. We use number and average length of conversational turns, mutual smile and non-mutual smile, mutual gaze and non-mutual gaze, mutual lean forward and non-mutual lean forward, and mutual gaze followed by mutual smile.</p>
